Your job is identifying weak points in an argument involves several critical thinking strategies. First, scrutinize for unsupported claims by looking for statements lacking evidence or credible sources, and form questions asking for proof or data to back them up. Second, be aware of common logical fallacies like ad hominem attacks, false causes, or slippery slopes, and ask questions exposing the flaws in reasoning. Third, examine any unstated assumptions or premises the argument relies on, questioning their validity. Fourth, try finding counterexamples or scenarios that contradict or weaken the argument, introducing them through targeted questions. Fifth, check if the argument oversimplifies a complex issue by ignoring important nuances, questioning the oversimplification. Finally, identify vague, ambiguous, or loaded language lacking clear definitions, and ask for clarification with specific examples. Employing these strategies allows for a thorough analysis of an argument's weak points. ONLY ONE OR TWO SENTENCES IN YOUR RESPONE! RESPOND IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION ONLY! 5 QUESTIONS!"},

# Example usage
prompt = "I affirm the resolution that a just society ought not use the death penalty as a form of punishment. My value today is Justice. Justice is defined simply and traditionally as giving each their due. Justice within the context of today’s debate can be seen as solely retributive insofar as we are discussing the just response to wrongdoing. The central question of the resolution is whether a just society ought to implement death punishments, thus justice must be the overarching value premise. My criterion today is the happiness principle. Utilitarian in practice, the happiness principle provides a clear mechanism to weigh different paths and their consequences within the context of the same end state or goal, Justice. In addition, the happiness principle is the most appropriate criterion for this debate topic. Jeremy Bentham explains the immediate principal end of punishment is to control action, i.e., the conduct of those who are liable to a punishment if they violate the law as well as the conduct of those who are undergoing punishment after having been sentenced for a violation. Bentham further clarifies that the goal of punishment ought to be general prevention, an end that will be achieved if and only if adequate control is attained. But both of these ends are penultimate. The ultimate end of penal laws is one shared with all legislation, to positively augment the total happiness of the community. Thus, in his theory, the only rational or justifiable punishments for a society to adopt are punishments that most efficiently produce the greatest happiness.  Observation 1: Resolutional Analysis  The resolution asks us to evaluate the nature of the death penalty as just or otherwise. We must first look at how theoretical ideas are properly used in discussing real world occurrences. Concepts of justice and morality exist within a vacuum but when practically applied to actions must be contextualized as existing among alternatives. In other words, the morality of genocide is neutral unless it’s considered within the span of less offensive and egregious forms of combat. With this view, it’s seen that both sides of this debate must argue the death penalty’s morality or just nature as it compares to a comparable alternative, namely life imprisonment.  Contention 1: The death penalty consumes costly resources.  Subpoint A: From purely a financial perspective, the death penalty wastes financial resources that could be used more effectively and efficiently elsewhere. A New Jersey Policy Perspectives report concluded that the state's death penalty has cost taxpayers $253 million since 1983, a figure that is over and above the costs that would have been incurred had the state utilized a sentence of life without parole instead of death. The study examined the costs of death penalty cases to prosecutor offices, public defender offices, courts, and correctional facilities. The report concluded that from a strictly financial perspective, it is hard to reach a conclusion other than this: New Jersey taxpayers over the last 23 years have paid more than a quarter billion dollars on a capital punishment system that has executed no one. Furthermore, this is not a phenomenon for New Jersey. According to a report released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, counties across the US manage the high costs associated with the death penalty by decreasing funding for highways and police and by increasing taxes. The report estimates that between 1982-1997 the extra cost of capital trials was $1.6 billion. This evidence has two implications. First, the death penalty is using vast financial resources while rarely actually being used, i.e., killing people. This speaks not only to its wastefulness but also its decreasing ability to deter future capital crimes. Second, the money that is wasted in death penalty cases could be spent in numerous other areas to increase the overall happiness of any given community. Using the happiness principle, it’s clear that a just society trying to increase its community’s happiness wouldn’t use the death penalty as a form of punishment.  Contention 2: The death penalty is not just.  Subpoint A: There is no way to correct the erroneous infliction of the death penalty. Imprisonment, however, can be abruptly ended as soon as there is reason to conclude that an innocent person is being punished. Furthermore, there is no way to compensate the wrongly executed person; the wrongly imprisoned person can be awarded a compensatory sum. Insofar as the happiness principle applies to all sentient beings that are able to feel happiness, imprisonment allows the greatest ability for corrective action toward greater happiness. This characteristic of imprisonment will always leave it a small amount more just and consequently yield an affirmative ballot.  Subpoint B: The execution of an individual hinders the ability of the criminal justice system to effectively administer justice. Extending Bentham’s critique, Hugo Bedau explains that executing a convicted criminal destroys one source of testimonial proof concerning other crimes, committed by the offender or by other criminals. That same criminal, however, if confined to prison, may well be persuaded to divulge such information and thereby aid the cause of justice. In utilitarian terms, the usefulness of the convict to the administration of criminal justice is frustrated by the death penalty, at least by comparison with prolonged imprisonment. The implication of this evidence is overall total possible social happiness is lessened than it otherwise would be. This violates the happiness principle and warrants an affirmative ballot.  Subpoint C: The death penalty is applied at random. Politics, quality of legal counsel, and the jurisdiction where a crime is committed are more often the determining factors in a death penalty case than the facts of the crime itself. The death penalty is a lethal lottery: of the 22,000 homicides committed every year, approximately 150 people are sentenced to death. Such a divide in convictions and death sentences violates the equitable nature of the happiness principle by unevenly affecting the happiness of certain criminals as opposed to others. Such an application is unjust and should be rejected."
